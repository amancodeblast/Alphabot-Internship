### XML format
- Tags
  - Groups      
  ```<something> something else </something>```
  - Single-line   
  ```<something />```
  - Comment     
  ```<!--something-->```
- Attributes
  - Tags can have attributes. Here, tag 'something'  has attribute 'text' with value 'hello' and 'number' with value 'aa'    
  ```<something text="hello" number="aa"/>```
  - Or, for groups    
  ```<something text="hello" number="aa"> ... </something>```

# Substitution tags
  - ```$(env ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)```
    - Substituted for variable of ```ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE```
  - ```$(optenv ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE DEFAULT_VALUE)```
    - If ```ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE``` is not defined, value ```DEFAULT_VALUE``` is taken
  - ```$(find PACKAGE_NAME)```
    - Substituted for path to package ```PACKAGE_NAME``` (path from ```rospack find PACKAGE_NAME```
  - ```$(anon NAME)```
    - Substituted for an anonymised version of ```NAME```
    - Multiple invocations on same ```NAME``` give the same result
  - ```$(arg FOO)```
    - Substituted for value specified by argument ```FOO```, defined in an ```<arg>``` tag
  - ```$(dirname)```
    - Substituted for directory name of the launch file
  - ```$(eval EXPRESSION)```
    - Evaluates the ```EXPRESSION```
